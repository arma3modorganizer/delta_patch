* Parameterize signature generation by file format to support different strong and weak sums?

* Error type for this crate?

* Maybe accumulate stats about how much was read, written, etc.

* Maybe rename crate and repo to just `rdiff`? 

  (Reduces stuttering in file names, makes it easier to get the binary tool, better Rust style?)
